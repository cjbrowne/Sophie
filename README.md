## Sophie
Simple, Original-Personality Human Interface Experiment

## The name
What's in a name?  A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

Well, in this name there's an attempt to make an allusion to the greek word 
"Sophos" meaning "wisdom", which is what I shall attempt to bestow upon our 
plucky little AI.  Not just wisdom, but an entire personality!  Wow!

## The code
### NLP/
The NLP directory contains all the gubbins Sophie uses to interpret natural
language.  I've not written it yet so I can't tell you anything more about it.

### GPP/
The GPP (Genuine People Personality) directory contains all the stuff that
makes Sophie behave like a genuine person.  In other words, it's the part of
her "brain" that deals with emotion.

### src/
The src directory contains Sophie's front-end - that is, the thing that links
her brain to you.  Think of it as her mouth and ears, if you will.  I have no
idea why you insist upon coming up with such ludicrously inaccurate anthropo-
morphic metaphors, but whatever.
