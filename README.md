## Sophie
Simple, Original-Personality Human Interface Experiment

## The name
What's in a name?  A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

Well, in this name there's an attempt to make an allusion to the greek word 
"Sophos" meaning "wisdom", which is what I shall attempt to bestow upon our 
plucky little AI.  Not just wisdom, but an entire personality!  Wow!

## The code
Coming soon!
